# Project Overview

Builder a starter theme that works well.

# Before you Begin

1. Rename the theme folder, `style.css`, package.json & composer.json
2. Update the paths in webpack.config.js
3. Add an `auth.json` file based on ACF instructions
4. Run `npm install` and `composer install` in your command line.
5. Publish as a new Github Repo
6. Move Repo to Choctaw Org

This next step might be wrong, but it's mostly correct.

7. Run `git remote add wpe git@git.wpengine.com`

Happy Editing!
